### Brief Introduction
Data is extremely essential in the field of machine learning. In terms of supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, 
a specific amount of data needs to be labeled for training algorithms. However, the process of labeling data is usually deemed to be time-consuming and painstaking, 
and even those applications which aim to simplify this process are mostly costly. Therefore, as the project requires, 
it is necessary to design and implement an open-source data labeling web application based on active learning, 
a cyclical procedure of selecting a small amount of promising data intelligently for users to label and using those data 
to refine the existing machine learning model. In other words, with this application, not only can users spend much less time doing data labeling, 
but they can also obtain a machine learning model with relatively better performance compared with labeling all the data sets that 
probably incorporate some meaningless and redundant data. The final experiment indicates that by using film review data set with the method of active learning, 
only about 80 pieces of texts are needed to be labeled in order to obtain an over 90% classification accuracy, 
while more than approximately 200 pieces of texts are needed to make the same achievement without using active learning, 
which indicates the significant practical value and research value that the project has. 
Additionally, at the end of this project, the evaluation of the application achieved was carried out to analyze the pros and cons that 
the application owned so as to make it improved in the future. <br><br>
